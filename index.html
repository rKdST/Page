<p>Mr. Data, A Data scientist used the previous climate data to generate a model to predict the climate and the world temperate. The predictions were hazardous. With the help of Atmospheric scientists, he began working on ways to prevent his prediction. All the questions they had<br> were linked to cooling our planet.</p>

<p>To overcome this issue mankind had to sacrifice activities, machines, exploiting resources. Mr. Data knew a selfish species could never do such a thing. Nevertheless, he went to people, used social media to spread the word but only a few acted and the evitable prediction became a reality.</p>

<p>Year 2050, Oil prices are high but also are the amount of cars. Breathing on the motorways has become a roadie’s task. People are now rich but the land they live and feed on is no more.<br> Sea levels have greatly increased making "Smooth sail" for the ships a myth.</p>

<p>People have built houses. They wanted timber roofs, they got. They still wanted paper when things were digital, guess they tried reducing electronic waste. The Resulted deforestation has greatly impacted the ways more than your functional imagination at 2023. erosions, landslides, roads are cracking, amount of oxygen has gone down. Parks and gardens are now greenhouse zones, covered from all 4 sides.  Wish these kinds today would enjoy the fresh air outside as much as I did. Since my brothers didn’t care they don’t have the outdoor we had.</p>

<p>Because, they wanted to incubate themselves in a car to commute. Wanted the cool breeze from its ventilators to protect them from the climate outside. Their car was releasing greenhouse gasses to make them feel comfortable, making the nature angry.<br> Their children are now paying for their acts.</p>


<p>Because they wanted more goods and the lack of knowledge to waste management and recycling the companies had to increase their production, constructing more production units, more chimneys and the result i see today wearing a gas mask looking at the red sky<br> which was once blue at 5pm.</p>


<p><center>I'm Mr. Data. Writing this in the year 2050. <br>Wish they had heard me then.</center></p>
